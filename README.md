<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Yurii</h1>

<p>I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with extensive experience in web and software development. </p>
<p>Over 8 years, I've worked on<b> a variety of remote jobs</b>, specializing in React, Node.js, TypeScript, and scalable system architecture.</p>

<p>🔹 I recently created this new GitHub account for <b>freelancing</b>, as my previous work was primarily on GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jira. <br>
    Due to NDA restrictions, I can't share past repositories, but I've migrated select projects that are not affected by <b>NDAs.</b></p>

<p>🚀 I'm excited to collaborate with new teams and contribute to impactful projects.</p>
<p>🙏 Big thanks to those who continue to support and follow me—I truly appreciate it!</p>

Let's build something amazing together! 💻✨
